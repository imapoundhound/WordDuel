## üéØ **GitHub Pages Configuration Example for Your Project**

### **Current Repository Details:**
- **GitHub Username**: `imapoundhound`
- **Repository Name**: `WordDuel_Too_Project`
- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Root Folder**: `/` (contains your `index.html` and `WordDuel.html`)

### **GitHub Pages Settings (What You'll See):**

```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
```

### **What This Means:**
- **Source**: GitHub will deploy from your code repository (not from GitHub Actions)
- **Branch**: It will use the `main` branch (which you're already on)
- **Folder**: It will serve files from the root directory of your repository

### **Your Live URL Will Be:**
```
https://imapoundhound.github.io/WordDuel_Too_Project/
```

### **Files That Will Be Served:**
- `index.html` ‚Üí Main entry point (redirects to game)
- `WordDuel.html` ‚Üí The actual game
- All other assets in the root folder

### **Why This Configuration Works:**
1. **`index.html`** is the standard entry point for web servers
2. **Root folder** (`/`) contains all your web files
3. **Main branch** is your production code
4. **No build process needed** - GitHub Pages serves static files directly

This is the perfect setup for your WordDuel project since you have all the web files ready to go in the root directory!
