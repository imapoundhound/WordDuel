# Notes for Berg-Style Mini Disc
# This profile is optimized for Flashforge Black Flexible printing
# Use for middle 20% layers (jellyfish design portion)
# Flexible filament requires slower speeds and careful handling
# Ensure proper bed adhesion and avoid over-extrusion
# Monitor for stringing and adjust retraction if needed
